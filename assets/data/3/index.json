I had always dreamed of becoming a software engineer, but I didn't know how to make that dream a reality. I felt like I was stuck in a dead-end job, and that my dream of becoming an engineer was slipping further and further away.\n\nOne day, I came across the quote from \"The Alchemist\" that reads, \"If you really want something, all the universe conspires to make it happen.\" Those words spoke to me in a way that I can't quite describe. They gave me a sense of hope and possibility that I had been missing.\n\nWhat I love about this quote is that it speaks to the idea that our dreams are possible, even when they may seem impossible at first. It reminds us that when we have a clear intention and a strong desire, the universe can conspire to help us in ways that we may not have even imagined.\n\nBut this quote is not just about wishful thinking or waiting for things to magically happen. It's about taking action towards our goals and being open to the opportunities and resources that come our way. When we are aligned with our true purpose and take action towards it, the universe can work with us to make it happen.\n\nI have seen this quote come to life in my own experiences as a self-taught developer. When I had a strong desire to learn how to code and break into the tech industry, I took action towards my goal. I started teaching myself to code, attending meetups, and networking with other developers. And as I continued to work hard towards my goals, opportunities and resources started to appear seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nThis quote also reminds me of the power of visualization and manifestation in our lives. When we can clearly visualize our goals and desires, and feel the emotions associated with them, we can send out a powerful signal to the universe that we are ready to receive them. The universe can then work to bring those desires into reality.\n\nOur dreams are possible, and that when we take action towards them, the universe can work in our favor to help us achieve them. So let's keep pushing ourselves towards our goals, and trust that the universe is on our side. ðŸ¤™ -->\n<!-- \n<div style=\"margin-top:30px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\">\n**GIFs are not my own, you can check them in <a href=\"https://giphy.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</div> -->\n","excerpt":"Go back Home!!
