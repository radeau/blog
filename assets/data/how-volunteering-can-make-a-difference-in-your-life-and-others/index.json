Back in my senior year at University, six of my classmates and I took on the challenge of organizing an event for a cause. We were moved to help the victims of an earthquake that struck Bohol in the Philippines. Despite the hurdles, we remained steadfast in our goal to make a difference. Thanks to our generous sponsors and tireless volunteers, we were able to raise enough funds to extend assistance to those who needed it the most. That experience taught me the power of collective effort.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, I had the privilege to volunteer for the Bridges of Giving campaign, organized by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Initiatives and Emirates Red Crescent in the United Arab Emirates. This campaign aimed to provide food parcels for earthquake victims in Syria and Turkey.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <img src=\"../with-co-volunteer.JPG\" alt=\"photo op with co-volunteer\" style=\"height: 60%; width:80%;\" />\n</div>\n<p>The task was simple, yet fulfilling. I helped pack food parcels containing essential items like rice, canned goods, sugar, clothing, and other basic necessities that could help families survive for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>The campaign brought together a diverse group of volunteers from different walks of life. We all shared a common purpose, which was to help those in need.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:60%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/YCGpMNQksFKghoMiPc\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>At the end of the event, we had packed hundreds (or thousands maybe) of food parcels, and it was an incredible feeling to know that we had made a difference. The event not only helped the earthquake victims, but it also brought the community together to support a cause. The sense of community was one of the things that struck me the most during the event.</p>\n<p>Volunteering for Bridges of Giving was an experience that reminded me of the power of collective effort. No matter how small our contribution may be, what counts is that we are making a positive impact on the world. It's easy to get caught up in our daily lives and forget about the things that matter, but events like these remind us that there is always something we can do to help others.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of Bridges of Giving and to have been able to make a difference in the lives of the earthquake victims in Syria and Turkey.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <img src=\"../volunteer.jpg\" alt=\"selfie with co-volunteer\" style=\"height: 30%; width:30%;\" />\n</div>\n<p>If you're considering volunteering, I encourage you to take the leap and do it. Whether you're volunteering for a large-scale event or a small one, every contribution counts. You'll be surprised at how much you can learn and grow as a person. Volunteering is a rewarding experience that benefits both the people you're helping and yourself.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:75%;height:0;padding-bottom:42%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/EfHmlClbuNAGc\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n </div>\n<p>Remember, every little help can make a big impact. So, let's all take part in building a better world, one act of kindness at a time.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:30px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\">\n    **GIFs are not my own, you can check them in <a href=\"https://giphy.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
