I mean the type of cooking that involves creating dishes that make Gordon Ramsay's mouth water.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/Yl4X3JyLv6fEVbTXKL\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>Yes, the art of cooking - a true masterpiece! Some may think it's just about throwing a bunch of ingredients together and hoping for the best, but oh, how wrong they are. Cooking is a true art form, requiring creativity, skill, and a dash of courage to try new things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-how-did-i-become-the-masterchef-at-home-yes-a-masterchef\"><a href=\"#but-how-did-i-become-the-masterchef-at-home-yes-a-masterchef\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>But how did I become the MasterChef at home? Yes, a MasterChef!</h3>\n<p>Little did I know, my mom had a trick up her sleeve. You see, I was too young to realize that she was just saying my food was good so that I would take over the cooking chore. And boy, did I fall for it hook, line, and sinker.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/9SIqGto42x4oHpkS5z\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>But you know what? I'm glad she did. It gave me the confidence to keep experimenting in the kitchen, to keep pushing the boundaries of what was possible, and to keep impressing my family with my culinary creations (even if they were just being nice to me).</p>\n<p>And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like the feeling of creating a dish that not only looks amazing but tastes even better. Seeing the look of joy on someone's face as they take that first bite is like a chef's version of winning an Oscar. It's the ultimate validation that all the time and effort put into the dish was worth it.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:53%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/l0Exilgks3XFeHErK\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div\n<p>But here's the thing - cooking isn't just about impressing others. It's also about exploring your own tastes and preferences, discovering new ingredients and flavor combinations, and finding what truly makes your taste buds sing. It's a journey of self-discovery and culinary exploration, and there's no better way to get there than by putting on that apron and diving in (no apron in reality though).</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-advice\"><a href=\"#my-advice\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>My advice..?</h3>\n<p>So here's my advice to you, dear reader: don't be afraid to unleash your inner chef. Who knows, you might just discover the next Fried Chicken ala McJobee and Adobo in white sauce with pickled onions on top - such a masterpiece. And even if your food isn't that great, just remember that your family and friends will probably say <strong>it's delicious anyway</strong>.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:30px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\">\n**GIFs are not my own, you can check them in <a href=\"https://giphy.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</div>\n","description":"Nothing but what passion is","timeToRead":2,"cover":"/blog/pylyp-sukhenko-y-XZf_TNRms-unsplash.jpg","fullscreen":false,"author":{"id":"kevin-rad","title":"kevin-rad","path":"/author/kevin-rad/"},"tags":[{"id":"personal-stories","title":"personal-stories","path":"/tag/personal-stories/"}]}},"context":{}}
