I learned how to set up my React environment, including installing Node.js and using the create-react-app command to create a new React project.</p>\n<p>One of the important topics that I learned today is what JSX is and how it works in React. I learned that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files. This makes it easier to create and manage our user interface in React.</p>\n<p>To practice using JSX, I completed some exercises, including creating a new component called Title that renders a heading element with a text prop, and another component called Button that renders a button element with a label prop.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to tomorrow's lesson, I am excited to learn more about React components and how they work, including how to create and render components, and how to use props and state to pass data between components.</p>\n","description":"Learning React in 30 Days","timeToRead":1,"cover":"","fullscreen":false,"author":{"id":"kevin-rad","title":"kevin-rad","path":"/author/kevin-rad/"},"tags":[{"id":"30-days-of-react","title":"30-days-of-react","path":"/tag/30-days-of-react/"},{"id":"front-end-development","title":"front-end-development","path":"/tag/front-end-development/"}]}},"context":{}}
