Ever since discovering it through Andrew Huberman's podcasts, I have been regularly practicing yoga nidra for a while now. During a recent session, I had an experience that left me feeling both inexplicably rested and somewhat surreal.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n<div style=\"width:50%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/TZSKYySNOFu0JUqIyQ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<!-- > \"It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was\n> floating freely in space.\" -->\n<p>I settled into my practice, listening to the guide's soothing voice as I relaxed into a state of deep relaxation. As the minutes passed, I began to feel a sensation of levitation throughout my body. It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was floating freely in space.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that\ngrew larger and larger as I let myself go.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I went deeper into my sensations, I suddenly found myself in a new experience. It was as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that grew larger and larger as I let myself go. I felt myself fighting against it, afraid to go further into the unknown.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/FRuActlQlBqWA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>But as I fought back, I began to realize that this experience was not to be feared. It was a journey into my subconscious mind, a place where I could explore my deepest thoughts, emotions, and desires. I felt a sense of wonder and curiosity as I allowed myself to surrender to the experience.</p>\n<p>When the practice ended, I felt a deep sense of rest and relaxation, as if I had just awoken from a deep and restful sleep. The experience was surreal, yet transformative. It allowed me to tap into a deeper level of awareness and connect with a part of myself that I don't often access in my daily life.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:40%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/el7Y5DVVAxu2uBa5ZG\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you're feeling stressed, anxious, or just plain curious, you should give Yoga Nidra a try. It's a powerful way to explore your inner world and tap into your creativity.

Some may think it's just about throwing a bunch of ingredients together and hoping for the best, but oh, how wrong they are. Cooking is a true art form, requiring creativity, skill, and a dash of courage to try new things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-how-did-i-become-the-masterchef-at-home-yes-a-masterchef\"><a href=\"#but-how-did-i-become-the-masterchef-at-home-yes-a-masterchef\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>But how did I become the MasterChef at home? Yes, a MasterChef!</h3>\n<p>Little did I know, my mom had a trick up her sleeve. You see, I was too young to realize that she was just saying my food was good so that I would take over the cooking chore. And boy, did I fall for it hook, line, and sinker.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/9SIqGto42x4oHpkS5z\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>But you know what? I'm glad she did. It gave me the confidence to keep experimenting in the kitchen, to keep pushing the boundaries of what was possible, and to keep impressing my family with my culinary creations (even if they were just being nice to me).</p>\n<p>And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like the feeling of creating a dish that not only looks amazing but tastes even better. Seeing the look of joy on someone's face as they take that first bite is like a chef's version of winning an Oscar. It's the ultimate validation that all the time and effort put into the dish was worth it.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:53%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/l0Exilgks3XFeHErK\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div\n<p>But here's the thing - cooking isn't just about impressing others. It's also about exploring your own tastes and preferences, discovering new ingredients and flavor combinations, and finding what truly makes your taste buds sing. It's a journey of self-discovery and culinary exploration, and there's no better way to get there than by putting on that apron and diving in (no apron in reality though).</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-advice\"><a href=\"#my-advice\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>My advice..?</h3>\n<p>So here's my advice to you, dear reader: don't be afraid to unleash your inner chef. Who knows, you might just discover the next Fried Chicken ala McJobee and Adobo in white sauce with pickled onions on top - such a masterpiece. And even if your food isn't that great, just remember that your family and friends will probably say <strong>it's delicious anyway</strong>.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:30px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\">\n**GIFs are not my own, you can check them in <a href=\"https://giphy.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
