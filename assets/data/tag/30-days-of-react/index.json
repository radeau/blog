I learned that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files. This makes it easier to create and manage our user interface in React.</p>\n<p>To practice using JSX, I completed some exercises, including creating a new component called Title that renders a heading element with a text prop, and another component called Button that renders a button element with a label prop.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to tomorrow's lesson, I am excited to learn more about React components and how they work, including how to create and render components, and how to use props and state to pass data between components.</p>\n","excerpt":"Today was the first day of my 30 days of learning React journey.
