I learned that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files. This makes it easier to create and manage our user interface in React.</p>\n<p>To practice using JSX, I completed some exercises, including creating a new component called Title that renders a heading element with a text prop, and another component called Button that renders a button element with a label prop.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to tomorrow's lesson, I am excited to learn more about React components and how they work, including how to create and render components, and how to use props and state to pass data between components.</p>\n","excerpt":"Today was the first day of my 30 days of learning React journey.

The program is designed to be highly selective and challenging, making it one of the most sought-after training programs in the tech industry. The name \"Piscine\" means \"swimming pool\" in French, which symbolizes the immersion into the coding world.

The 26-day program was intense and challenging, but it was also incredibly rewarding. The program was designed to provide hands-on experience in coding, problem-solving, and collaboration. The curriculum covered various programming languages such as C, Python, and Web Development, and it was taught by experienced instructors who were knowledgeable and supportive.

The program was attended by individuals from all over the world, and it was amazing to see how everyone came together to support each other and learn from each other. The collaboration aspect of the program was very much a part of the learning experience, and it taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>In September 2021, we received the results of the program, and I was thrilled to learn that I had passed. The program had given me the confidence and skills needed to pursue a career in the tech industry, and I was eager to see where this journey would take me.</p>\n","excerpt":"If you're someone who's interested in technology and is looking for a unique and challenging learning experience, then you might have heard about 42 Abu Dhabi Piscine.
