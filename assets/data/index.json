Ever since discovering it through Andrew Huberman's podcasts, I have been regularly practicing yoga nidra for a while now. During a recent session, I had an experience that left me feeling both inexplicably rested and somewhat surreal.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n<div style=\"width:50%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/TZSKYySNOFu0JUqIyQ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<!-- > \"It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was\n> floating freely in space.\" -->\n<p>I settled into my practice, listening to the guide's soothing voice as I relaxed into a state of deep relaxation. As the minutes passed, I began to feel a sensation of levitation throughout my body. It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was floating freely in space.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that\ngrew larger and larger as I let myself go.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I went deeper into my sensations, I suddenly found myself in a new experience. It was as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that grew larger and larger as I let myself go. I felt myself fighting against it, afraid to go further into the unknown.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/FRuActlQlBqWA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>But as I fought back, I began to realize that this experience was not to be feared. It was a journey into my subconscious mind, a place where I could explore my deepest thoughts, emotions, and desires. I felt a sense of wonder and curiosity as I allowed myself to surrender to the experience.</p>\n<p>When the practice ended, I felt a deep sense of rest and relaxation, as if I had just awoken from a deep and restful sleep. The experience was surreal, yet transformative. It allowed me to tap into a deeper level of awareness and connect with a part of myself that I don't often access in my daily life.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:40%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/el7Y5DVVAxu2uBa5ZG\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you're feeling stressed, anxious, or just plain curious, you should give Yoga Nidra a try.

I wanted to let things happen and see where the wind would take me. After all, life is unpredictable, and you never know what kind of adventure awaits you!</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/QhNVIHbX6w9pmMPm8M\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n    <p style=\"margin:10px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\" >An island in PalawanüèùÔ∏è</p>\n</div>\n<p>The first thing I did upon arriving was to dive right into the Filipino delicacy known as balut. For those of you who aren't familiar, it's a boiled or steamed duck egg eaten straight out of the shell. And let me tell you, it's an experience that's not for the faint of heart! But hey, you gotta try everything at least once, right? </p>\n<p>Then, I decided to take a trip down memory lane and visit some of the places where I used to work. It was a real blast from the past, and I got to relive some of the fond memories I had there.</p>\n<p>Next up, I hopped on a Ship and traveled to Iloilo City. I explore the city with my younger sister, who knows the place like the back of her hand. Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other plans, and a strong typhoon hit Iloilo, so we had to stay there for a bit longer than we anticipated. But you know what they say, <strong>when life gives you lemons, make lemonade!</strong> We took advantage of the extra time and explored Iloilo a bit more, indulging in some of the cheap but delicious food they had to offer. My favorite was definitely the La Paz Batchoy, and let me tell you, the Bulalo was so tasty that it made me want to slap my sister! haha</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/XQc7B96BReraGSoMRf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>Then, I made my way to Cuyo, Palawan, the place where I grew up and spent most of my childhood. The island may be small and simple, but it's rich in culture and food resources. And don't even get me started on the view! Our house faces the sea, and watching the sunset was like something out of a dream.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/YgpEQjWzZd9hTBa2i2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n    <p style=\"margin:10px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\">When I say sunset, I mean thisüëÜ</p>\n</div>\n<p>There's a lot more to tell but this is it for now. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"...the best adventures are the ones that you don't plan for.\"</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My whirlwind trip to the Philippines, full of unexpected twists and turns.

Some may think it's just about throwing a bunch of ingredients together and hoping for the best, but oh, how wrong they are. Cooking is a true art form, requiring creativity, skill, and a dash of courage to try new things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-how-did-i-become-the-masterchef-at-home-yes-a-masterchef\"><a href=\"#but-how-did-i-become-the-masterchef-at-home-yes-a-masterchef\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>But how did I become the MasterChef at home? Yes, a MasterChef!</h3>\n<p>Little did I know, my mom had a trick up her sleeve. You see, I was too young to realize that she was just saying my food was good so that I would take over the cooking chore. And boy, did I fall for it hook, line, and sinker.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/9SIqGto42x4oHpkS5z\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<p>But you know what? I'm glad she did. It gave me the confidence to keep experimenting in the kitchen, to keep pushing the boundaries of what was possible, and to keep impressing my family with my culinary creations (even if they were just being nice to me).</p>\n<p>And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like the feeling of creating a dish that not only looks amazing but tastes even better. Seeing the look of joy on someone's face as they take that first bite is like a chef's version of winning an Oscar. It's the ultimate validation that all the time and effort put into the dish was worth it.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:53%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/l0Exilgks3XFeHErK\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div\n<p>But here's the thing - cooking isn't just about impressing others. It's also about exploring your own tastes and preferences, discovering new ingredients and flavor combinations, and finding what truly makes your taste buds sing. It's a journey of self-discovery and culinary exploration, and there's no better way to get there than by putting on that apron and diving in (no apron in reality though).</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-advice\"><a href=\"#my-advice\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>My advice..?</h3>\n<p>So here's my advice to you, dear reader: don't be afraid to unleash your inner chef. Who knows, you might just discover the next Fried Chicken ala McJobee and Adobo in white sauce with pickled onions on top - such a masterpiece. And even if your food isn't that great, just remember that your family and friends will probably say <strong>it's delicious anyway</strong>.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-top:30px;font-size:14px;font-style:italic\">\n**GIFs are not my own, you can check them in <a href=\"https://giphy.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</div>\n","excerpt":"I'm not talking about your everyday burnt toast or scrambled eggs (although I have a Ph.D. in the latter).
