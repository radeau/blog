I learned how to set up my React environment, including installing Node.js and using the create-react-app command to create a new React project.</p>\n<p>One of the important topics that I learned today is what JSX is and how it works in React. I learned that JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files. This makes it easier to create and manage our user interface in React.</p>\n<p>To practice using JSX, I completed some exercises, including creating a new component called Title that renders a heading element with a text prop, and another component called Button that renders a button element with a label prop.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to tomorrow's lesson, I am excited to learn more about React components and how they work, including how to create and render components, and how to use props and state to pass data between components.</p>\n","excerpt":"Today was the first day of my 30 days of learning React journey.

Ever since discovering it through Andrew Huberman's podcasts, I have been regularly practicing yoga nidra for a while now. During a recent session, I had an experience that left me feeling both inexplicably rested and somewhat surreal.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n<div style=\"width:50%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/TZSKYySNOFu0JUqIyQ\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<!-- > \"It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was\n> floating freely in space.\" -->\n<p>I settled into my practice, listening to the guide's soothing voice as I relaxed into a state of deep relaxation. As the minutes passed, I began to feel a sensation of levitation throughout my body. It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was floating freely in space.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that\ngrew larger and larger as I let myself go.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I went deeper into my sensations, I suddenly found myself in a new experience. It was as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that grew larger and larger as I let myself go. I felt myself fighting against it, afraid to go further into the unknown.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/FRuActlQlBqWA\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>But as I fought back, I began to realize that this experience was not to be feared. It was a journey into my subconscious mind, a place where I could explore my deepest thoughts, emotions, and desires. I felt a sense of wonder and curiosity as I allowed myself to surrender to the experience.</p>\n<p>When the practice ended, I felt a deep sense of rest and relaxation, as if I had just awoken from a deep and restful sleep. The experience was surreal, yet transformative. It allowed me to tap into a deeper level of awareness and connect with a part of myself that I don't often access in my daily life.</p>\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin:10%\">\n    <div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:40%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/el7Y5DVVAxu2uBa5ZG\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you're feeling stressed, anxious, or just plain curious, you should give Yoga Nidra a try. It's a powerful way to explore your inner world and tap into your creativity. And who knows, you might just end up floating in space too (figuratively, of course). </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yoga is not about touching your toes,\nit's about what you learn on the way down.\"\n~Jigar</p>\n</blockquote>\n","excerpt":"Yoga Nidra, also referred to as \"yogic sleep,\" is an incredibly potent meditation technique that has the ability to take you on a profound journey deep into your subconscious mind.
