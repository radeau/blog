Yoga Nidra, also referred to as "yogic sleep," is an incredibly potent meditation technique that has the ability to take you on a profound journey deep into your subconscious mind. Ever since discovering it through Andrew Huberman's podcasts, I have been regularly practicing yoga nidra for a while now. During a recent session, I had an experience that left me feeling both inexplicably rested and somewhat surreal.

I settled into my practice, listening to the guide's soothing voice as I relaxed into a state of deep relaxation. As the minutes passed, I began to feel a sensation of levitation throughout my body. It was as if my body was no longer bound to the earth and I was floating freely in space.

As I went deeper into my sensations, I suddenly found myself in a new experience. It was as if I was being vacuumed into a portal, a black oval that grew larger and larger as I let myself go. I felt myself fighting against it, afraid to go further into the unknown.

But as I fought back, I began to realize that this experience was not to be feared. It was a journey into my subconscious mind, a place where I could explore my deepest thoughts, emotions, and desires. I felt a sense of wonder and curiosity as I allowed myself to surrender to the experience.

When the practice ended, I felt a deep sense of rest and relaxation, as if I had just awoken from a deep and restful sleep. The experience was surreal, yet transformative. It allowed me to tap into a deeper level of awareness and connect with a part of myself that I don't often access in my daily life.

If you're feeling stressed, anxious, or just plain curious, you should give Yoga Nidra a try. It's a powerful way to explore your inner world and tap into your creativity. And who knows, you might just end up floating in space too (figuratively, of course).
