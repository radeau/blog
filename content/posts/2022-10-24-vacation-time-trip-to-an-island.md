Hey there folks, I'm finally back in my homeland, the Philippines! After three long years, I'm ready to experience all the excitement and thrills that come with being home. But don't worry, I'm not going to bore you with a long list of things to do and places to go, because this time, I'm doing things differently.
I decided to try a new approach this time and didn't prepare a thorough itinerary like I did on my previous travel. I wanted to let things happen and see where the wind would take me. After all, life is unpredictable, and you never know what kind of adventure awaits you!

The first thing I did upon arriving was to dive right into the Filipino delicacy known as balut. For those of you who aren't familiar, it's a boiled or steamed duck egg eaten straight out of the shell. And let me tell you, it's an experience that's not for the faint of heart! But hey, you gotta try everything at least once, right? 

Then, I decided to take a trip down memory lane and visit some of the places where I used to work. It was a real blast from the past, and I got to relive some of the fond memories I had there.

Next up, I hopped on a Ship and traveled to Iloilo City. I explore the city with my younger sister, who knows the place like the back of her hand. Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other plans, and a strong typhoon hit Iloilo, so we had to stay there for a bit longer than we anticipated. But you know what they say, **when life gives you lemons, make lemonade!** We took advantage of the extra time and explored Iloilo a bit more, indulging in some of the cheap but delicious food they had to offer. My favorite was definitely the La Paz Batchoy, and let me tell you, the Bulalo was so tasty that it made me want to slap my sister! haha

Then, I made my way to Cuyo, Palawan, the place where I grew up and spent most of my childhood. The island may be small and simple, but it's rich in culture and food resources. And don't even get me started on the view! Our house faces the sea, and watching the sunset was like something out of a dream.

There's a lot more to tell but this is it for now.

My whirlwind trip to the Philippines, full of unexpected twists and turns. It just goes to show that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones that you don't plan for. So go out there and embrace the unexpected ‚Äì who knows, you might just have the time of your life!
